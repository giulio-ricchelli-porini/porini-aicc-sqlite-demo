## Assignment steps
* As done in the first assignment, clone this repo in the "GitClass" folder ("C:\Users\\%yourUsername%\Visual Studio Code\GitClass"); you should then have a new project folder in the "GitClass" folder dedicated to this project
* Update the code:
    * Update the "tasks" table so that it can also contain the mail about the person to whom the task has been assigned, in a new attribute called "assigned_to"
    * Update the ".gitignore" file so that Git ignores all the files with the ".db" extension in the project root folder, not only the one currently configured (to test this you can change the DB_NAME value in the "config.py" file, run "main.py" again and check that the db file is not included in the Git changes from the integrated "Source Control" tab in VSCode)
* Push your changes and merge to the "main" branch by using the integrated "Source Control" tab in VSCode
